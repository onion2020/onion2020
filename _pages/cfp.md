title: Call for papers
---

We invite paper submissions for the the first workshop on People in Language, Vision, and the Mind, which discuss how people, their bodies and faces as well as mental states are described in text. We are interested in contributions from diverse areas including language generation, language analysis, cognitive computing, affective computing.

We invite both short and long papers, which may fall into the following categories:

- Papers describing original research
- Survey and/or position papers
- Demo papers

*Authors are strongly encouraged to identify and discuss ethical issues arising from their work, insofar as it involves the use of image data or descriptions of people.*


Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

- Datasets of facial images and descriptions
- Methods for the creation and annotation of multimodal resources dedicated to the description of people
- Methods for the validation of  multimodal resources for descriptions of people
- Experimental studies of facial expression understanding by humans
- Models or algorithms for automatic facial description generation
- Emotion recognition by humans
- Multimodal automatic emotion recognition from images and text
- Subjectivity in face perception
- Communicative, relational and intentional aspects of head pose and eye-gaze
- Collection and annotation methods for facial descriptions
- Coding schemes for the annotation of body posture and facial expression
- Understanding and description of the human face and body in different contexts, including commercial applications, art, forensics, etc. 
- Modelling of the human body, face and facial expressions for embodied conversational agents
- Generation of full-body images and/or facial images from textual descriptions
- Ethical and data protection issues related to the collection and/or automatic description of images of real people
- Any form of bias in models which seek to make sense of human physical attributes in language and vision.




## Submission guidelines
Short paper submissions may consist of up to 4 pages of content, while long papers may have up to 8 pages of content. References do not count towards these page limits.
All submissions must follow the LREC 2020 style files, which are available for LaTeX (preferred) and MS Word and can be retrieved from [here](https://lrec2020.lrec-conf.org/en/submission2020/authors-kit/).

Papers must be submitted digitally, in PDF, and uploaded through the [START submission system](https://www.softconf.com/lrec2020/ONION2020/) The authors of accepted papers will be required to submit a camera-ready version to be included in the final proceedings. Authors of accepted papers will be notified after the notification of acceptance with further details.

## Identify, Describe and Share your LRs!
Describing your LRs in the LRE Map is now a normal practice in the submission procedure of LREC (introduced in 2010 and adopted by other conferences). To continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014 about “Sharing LRs” (data, tools, web-services, etc.), authors will have the possibility,  when submitting a paper, to upload LRs in a special LREC repository.  This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description, may become a new “regular” feature for conferences in our field, thus contributing to creating a common repository where everyone can deposit and share data.

As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as to allow the community to understand the whole context and also replicate the experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2020 endorses the need to uniquely Identify LRs through the use of the [International Standard Language Resource Number](www.islrn.org) (ISLRN), a Persistent Unique Identifier to be assigned to each Language Resource. The assignment of ISLRNs to LRs cited in LREC papers  will be offered at submission time.
